This is a repo for the paper "Learning to solve the physician scheduling problem with time-varying demand and patient return".

The repo includes:
The datasets;  
The codes to train and validate the machine learning models;  
The codes to generate the training dataset (folder "weekly_scheduling_ml_data");  
The codes to the two-stage algorithm (folder "weekly_scheduling_two_stage").
